Ensemble is the platform that powers the Firefox Public Data Report, a weekly
public report on the activity, behavior, and hardware configuration of Firefox
Desktop users.

Ensemble fetches data from
[ensemble-transposer](https://github.com/mozilla/ensemble-transposer), a JSON
server that adds metadata to the raw data hosted by Mozilla data engineers.

Ensemble is written in React with the help of the wonderful
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool from
Facebook.

## Development

### Install

1. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
2. Run `yarn`

### Run

#### Locally

Run `yarn local`

#### On production

1. Run `yarn build`
2. Run `NODE_ENV=production yarn start`

### Test

Run `yarn validate` (**NB:** not `yarn test`; although `yarn test` does run some
tests, `yarn validate` does additional quality assurance like linting JavaScript
and checking for security vulnerabilities)

### Analyze

To analyze the size of the JavaScript bundle that will be served, run `yarn
size`.
