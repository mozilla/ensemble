            The Firefox Public Data Report is a weekly public report on the
            health, usage, and hardware configuration of Firefox.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this report is twofold. One: empower developers,
            journalists, and the overall public to better understand the state
            of the web and the direction of trends in desktop web browsing. Two:
            transparency. We believe in an open web. Data from the public should
            go to the public, for the public.
        </p>
        <p>
            The report is split into 3 sections: Health of Firefox, Web Usage,
            and Hardware Across the Web. Health of Firefox includes metrics for
            the the overall Firefox user population. Web Usage describes ways in
            which Firefox is being used. Hardware Across the Web details
            hardware specs and configurations for the machines running Firefox. 
        </p>

            All data is from a representative 1% sample from our Release channel
            and the report runs once a week. Each datapoint covers a weekâ€™s
            worth of data (unless stated otherwise). All data is anonymized and
            aggregated to ensure user privacy. Links to definitions for specific
            metrics and how they were generated can be found below.
